# EX-Capsule_Atmospheric_re_entry


## Overview
This repository contains a series of three exercises focused on atmospheric reentry trajectory simulations. These exercises are designed for example purposes and provide a hands-on approach to understanding the basic physics, numerical methods, and engineering challenges associated with reentry vehicles.

## Objectives
The primary goals of these exercises are:
- To model and simulate atmospheric reentry trajectories.
- To analyze aerodynamic forces, heating effects, and dynamic constraints.
- To showcase computational methods for re-entry analysis.

## Structure of the Repository
The repository is structured as follows:
- `Exercise_1/` - Fundamental reentry trajectory simulation, focusing on basic dynamics.
- `Exercise_2/` - Extended analysis including aerodynamic forces and drag modeling.
- `Exercise_3/` - Advanced case with heating effects and thermal protection considerations.

Each exercise includes:
- MATLAB scripts for numerical simulations.
- Plots and results for visualization and analysis.

## Prerequisites
To run these exercises, you will need:
- MATLAB and the Aerospace toolbox.
- Basic knowledge of orbital mechanics and fluid dynamics.
- A fundamental understanding of numerical integration methods (Euler, RK4, etc.).

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atmospheric-reentry.git
   cd atmospheric-reentry
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired exercise directory.
3. Run the provided scripts and explore the results.
4. Modify the parameters to experiment with different reentry scenarios.
